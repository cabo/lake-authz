Here is an initial sketch of how it could look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n# Enrollment hints\r\nThis section defines optional fields with the purpose of improving protocol scalability, aiming to reduce battery usage and enrollment delay.\r\nThe main use case is when several potential gateways (V) are detected by U's radio, which can lead to U trying to enroll (and failing) several times until it finds a suitable V.\r\n\r\n## Domain Authenticator hints\r\nIn case W denies the enrollment of U to a given V, a list of Domain Authenticator hints (v_hints) can be sent from W to U.\r\nThe hint is optional and is sent as part of an error message.\r\nIt consists of a list of application-defined identifiers of V (e.g. MAC addresses, SSIDs, PAN IDs, etc.), as defined below:\r\n\r\nv_hints = [ 1* bstr ]\r\n\r\n## Device hints\r\nU may send a Device hint (u_hint) so that it can help W to select which Vs to include in v_hints.\r\nThis can be useful in large scale scenarios with many gateways (V).\r\nThe hint is an optional field in EAD_1, and it must be encrypted.\r\nThe hint itself is application dependent, and can contain GPS coordinates, application-specific tags, the list of Vs detected by U, or other relevant information.\r\nIt is defined as follows:\r\n\r\nu_hint: [ 1* bstr ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n- related to #5, as `v_hint` would be carried in the Voucher Error message\r\n- all hints should be encrypted and integrity-protected, e.g., via `COSE_Encrypt0`",
