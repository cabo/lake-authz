Another reason that motivated me in considering this field was a discussion I had with @chrysn about the \"admin status of V\".\r\n- `directives-for-u` should contain any information that W may find useful to transmit to U.

Privacy of `u_hints`\r\n- At U: gateways (Vs) normally advertise their radio identifiers in beacons -> no issue.\r\n- At V: the hint is encrypted -> no issue.\r\n- At W: the radio identifiers of any V will be read by W\r\n  - \u26a0\ufe0f potential issue: if W shares the identifiers with 3rd parties\r\n  - mitigation: W should commit to not share the received identifiers.\r\n- in transit between U <-> V and V <-> W: the hint is encrypted -> no issue.\r\n\r\n### 2. Privacy of `v_hints`\r\n- At W: the radio identifiers of Vs that are securely associated with W will be read by W\r\n  - \u26a0\ufe0f potential issue: if W shares the identifiers with 3rd parties\r\n  - mitigation: W should commit to not share the received identifiers.\r\n  - \u2753note: since Vs are already associated with W, the Vs should already trust W to not share any information with 3rd parties. Thus I think this is a non-issue.\r\n- At V: the hint is encrypted -> no issue.\r\n- At U: the device U will gain information about Vs that allow U to enroll. \r\n  - \u26a0\ufe0f potential issue: if the device is malicious, it would be learning new information about the system\r\n  - mitigation: only return hints when U is known to W.\r\n    - example 1: device u1 is listed in W's ACL, but the V through which it tried to join is not in the ACL (leading to error \"Access Denied\"). Since W knows u1, it MAY return `v_hints`.\r\n    - example 2: device u2 is not listed in W's ACL (leading to error \"Access Denied\"). Since W does not know u2, it MUST NOT return `v_hints`.\r\n  - \u2753 note: is there an issue when U is known by W (as in example 1 above)? It would be learning about radio identifiers of Vs that might or might not be in its radio range and are expected to be authorized to enroll U. Personally I think this is a non-issue.\r\n- in transit between W <-> V and V <-> U: the hint is encrypted -> no issue.\r\n\r\n### Discussion\r\nI think that the only issues that we need to address in the document are `1. Privacy of u_hints at W` and `2. Privacy of v_hints at U (when U is unknown to W)`.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to receiving comments from those interested in this topic.",

Also, as a result of the present discussion, I think we can entirely discard the idea of sending GPS coordinates.\r\n\r\nAnother consideration is that just by having U trying to enroll via V, this already leaks some location information to W. For example, in Bluetooth or IEEE 802.15.4 or Wi-Fi one can easily expect a geolocation accuracy of a few tens of meters, given the MAC address of just one gateway. Of course triangulation of more gateways can improve that, but I would say e.g. 50 meters is already quite sensitive.\r\n\r\nNext, IIUC, your concerns regard only hints from U to W. Do you have concerns with the other way around? (where the manufacturer sends identifiers of gateways to a known device).\r\n\r\nI am taking a look at what the performance improvements could look like, might come back later with data.",

Specifically:\r\n- considering 10 available Vs and 5 hint items per message\r\n  - 3x faster join time, considering a 250 Kbps network with a scheduling timeslot of 10 ms (typical TSCH configuration)\r\n  - 2x faster join time, considering a 1 Mbps network with no scheduling cost (typical in Bluetooth)\r\n\r\nHints are more effective the more Vs there are available (e.g. may lead to a 10x improvement under certain conditions, provided there are > 25 available Vs). If available Vs = 5, there is no difference. If it is smaller than 5, using hints causes it to be slower.\r\n\r\nSo, it is a considerable improvement, although likely not a 10x factor in the average case.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nAt this point not sure about next steps.

Perhaps it is enough the way it is?\r\nNote that one reason to differentiate between known and unknown Us is the privacy of radio identifiers of Vs when using hints (v_hints specifically), as discussed in issue #27.",

For example we could:\r\n1. just tag a whole array, and all elements will have the same meaning\r\n2. put the tag as first element in the array\r\n\r\nThe advantage of (1) is using the tag as a proper tag, but the disadvantage is that the change in semantics of the data item might be misleading.\r\nAs for (2), it does not cause confusion with tag semantics, but it feels a bit hacky.",
