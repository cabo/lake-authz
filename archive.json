If we don't have a quick fix, make a separate issue.\r\n\r\nEdit: For example, add a flag in VRES\r\n\r\nVoucher_Response = [\r\n    message_1:      bstr,\r\n    flag:               int,\r\n    response:        bstr,\r\n    ? opaque_state: bstr\r\n]\r\n\r\nflag = -1 is used with response = Voucher.  In case of reject, then (flag, response) = error_content.\r\n\r\n(or other preferred construction)\r\n\r\nEdit: Or reserve REJECT_TYPE = 0 for the no reject case. The flag/ REJECT_TYPE thus becomes a status code for the VREQ/VRES protocol. Maybe rename \"REJECT_TYPE\" accordingly. Or leave out for this update. ",
